          Hey, I am a Junior at the University of Pennsylvania, studying Computer Science, and concentrating in Artificial Intelligence. My primary interests lie in AI/ML and designing fast and scalable algorithms for complex systems.

          Beyond the classroom, Iâ€™ve developed strong backend engineering skills and enjoy building reliable, performant APIs. Last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at Fulcrum GT, where I worked on AI-driven legal compliance system.
